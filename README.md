# Work Focus Blocker

## How It Works

Sites like LinkedIn and YouTube are unblocked by default. When you start a blocking session (e.g., 25 minutes), those sites become blocked and a green progress bar counts down. If you need temporary access during blocking, you can unblock for a few minutes—the main timer pauses, an orange bar tracks your break, then blocking automatically resumes where it left off.

## Installation

Download this repository, go to `chrome://extensions/`, enable Developer Mode (top-right toggle), click "Load unpacked", and select the `simple_blocker` folder. The extension icon will appear in your toolbar.
